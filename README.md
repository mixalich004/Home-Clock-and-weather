# Home-Clock-and-weather
The following libraries were used in this project: LiquidCrystal_I2C, Wire, 
OneWire, DallasTe Temperature, DS3231. 
The display shows the temperature from the external sensor 
and the temperature from the real-time clock sensor, as well as the time and date. 
In the future I plan to add an alarm clock and an external humidity sensor.
